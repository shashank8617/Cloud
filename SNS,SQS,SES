1. Check SNS to SQS Subscription
Ensure that the subscription between the SNS topic and the SQS queue is properly configured.
Go to the SNS dashboard, select the topic, and check the "Subscriptions" tab to verify that "DemoQueue" is listed as a subscribed endpoint.
2. Verify SQS Queue Policy
Ensure the SQS queue policy allows the SNS topic to send messages. The policy should be configured to allow SQS:SendMessage actions from the SNS topic ARN.
3. Check SNS Message Publishing
Confirm that the message was successfully published to the SNS topic.
Go to the SNS dashboard, select the topic, and check the "Publish message" section to see if any messages were sent recently.
4. Poll for Messages Again
Ensure you are polling the correct queue. Click "Poll for messages" in the SQS dashboard again and wait for a few moments.
Make sure you are using the appropriate polling settings. For example, a polling duration of 30 seconds is typical.
5. Review SQS Message Visibility
If you have previously received messages, they might be in a "Visibility Timeout" state. Try changing the "Visibility Timeout" setting temporarily to ensure messages can be retrieved.
6. Check CloudWatch Logs
Review CloudWatch logs for any potential errors or issues related to SNS or SQS. This can give you insights if there are any problems with message delivery.
7. Confirm Message Format
Ensure that the message format is compatible with SQS. SNS typically sends messages in JSON format, so ensure there are no issues with the format.
8. Message Retention
Check if the message retention period for the queue is set properly. Messages that exceed this period may not be available.
