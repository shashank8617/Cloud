###Using AWS Management Console or CLI, create a CloudWatch alarm that triggers when CPU utilization on an EC2 instance exceeds 70% for more than 5 minutes. Configure the alarm to send notifications via Amazon SNS.



###Configure CloudWatch Logs to collect and analyze logs from an EC2 instance running a web server. Demonstrate how to search and filter logs, create metric filters, and set up alarms based on specific log events (e.g., errors or warnings).



###Create a CloudWatch dashboard that displays key metrics (e.g., CPU utilization, network traffic) from multiple AWS services (e.g., EC2, S3). Customize the dashboard layout and widgets to provide a comprehensive overview of application performance.
